# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We are committed to providing security updates for the latest major release. Please ensure you are using the most recent version of the bot.

| Version | Supported          |

| `< 1.0` | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For reporting vulnerabilities within Diami-Py-Bot we make use of GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting feature (More information can be found
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)).
This ensures that all maintainers and key members have access to the reported
vulnerability.

### Opening a Vulnerability Report

This is the preferred method for reporting vulnerabilities.

1.  Navigate to the **"Security"** tab of the DiamiPyBot repository.
2.  Click the **"Report a vulnerability"** button.
3.  Fill out the form with as much detail as possible, including:
    *   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    *   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue.
    *   The affected version of the bot (if known).
    *   Any relevant code snippets, logs, or screenshots that can help diagnose the problem.
